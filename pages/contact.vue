            <body>Chloe Lynne Choi is a creative technologist 
            currently pursuing a Master’s of Professional Studies 
            at New York University Tisch in the Interactive Telecommunications 
            program. Her work focuses on recreating procedurally-generated artworks 
            in the physical space, slowing it down, and placing them in homes and 
            galleries. More specifically, Chloe’s aspiration is to capture the concept 
            of infinity within an artwork that lies within finite constraints so that 
            the piece is similar, but always somewhat different, every time someone views 
            the work.
